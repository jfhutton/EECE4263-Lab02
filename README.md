# Lab02
This week you’ll be using the NodeMCU ESP-12E to control a propeller attached to a DC motor. Specifically, you’ll be interfacing the NodeMCU with an L293D H-bridge motor driver chip, and the L293D will actually control the motor. The propeller, motor, and L293D are all part of the “Super Kit for Arduino” from SUNFOUNDER (www.sunfounder.com).

You have several turn-ins for this lab: A PDF of your completed lab handout sheet, a PDF of your professional-looking schematic, and your final lab code. All these need to be pushed to this Lab02 assignment repo *before* the beginning of our next lab. Also, you must demonstrate your working code to your instructor during the first few minutes of our next lab as well.

Enjoy!
